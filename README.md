# ðŸŽ¯ Number-Guessing-Game

A simple Python CLI game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 1,000,000. This project is a great starting point for beginners learning Python and basic control flow.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `number_guessing_game.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1. Run the notebook in Google Colab or locally using Jupyter.
2. A number is randomly selected between `0` and `1,000,000`.
3. You'll be asked to guess the number.
4. The program will tell you if the number is **larger** or **lower** than your guess.
5. Repeat until you guess it correctly!

## ðŸ§  Example Output

welcome to the number guessing game
guess a number between 0-1000000

    500000
    the number is larger than your guess

guess a number between 0-1000000

    800000
    the number is lower than your guess

guess a number between 0-1000000

    723456
    congo you guessed correctly


## ðŸ›  Requirements

    - Python 3.x

> To run it locally:
    
    python number_guessing_game.py

ðŸ’¡ What You Learn

    Basic use of random module

    While loops and conditionals

    User input and typecasting

ðŸ“ˆ Future Ideas

    Add a counter for number of attempts

    Add difficulty levels (range limiters)

    Add GUI with Tkinter or web version using Flask
